## ApplicationWithCustomOrder / AppWithG

This is an extension of my Bakery Management System I developed in first semester. Both are actually the same thing, but ApplicationWithCustomOrder is the Console App backend, while AppWithG is the GUI frontend utilizing the same backend.

The FrontEnd is developed in Windows Forms Framework of .NET . Below is the CRC of that project.
